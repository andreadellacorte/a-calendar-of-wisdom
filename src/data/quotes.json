During these pains we can understand and explain\nfor ourselves what will happen to us, and prepare for the new state of our next\nexistence. \n\n\n\nUsually\npeople think that it is possible to serve God and humanity only when you are\nhealthy. This is not true. Very often it is to the contrary. Christ served God\nand all mankind when he suffered on the cross, and even then he forgave those\nwho killed him. Every person can do likewise. You cannot say which state is\nbetter, a healthy or ill state, in the service of God and humankind. \n\n\n\nFor\nyourself, and for yourself only, it is necessary to have health and power. But\nto serve God it is not necessary, and sometimes even the opposite is true.  \n\n\n\nVery\noften, when I have dealt with terminally ill people, I have learned that the\nmost important thing is not hiding the approaching death from the patient, but\non the contrary, explaining to him his own divine, spiritual nature, which\ngrows in him and which cannot be destroyed by death. \n\n\nIllnesses almost always destroy one's physical\npower, and they release the power of one's soul. For a person who concentrates\nhis consciousness in the spiritual domain, illnesses do not diminish his\ngoodness, but on the contrary, they increase it.\n\n"
